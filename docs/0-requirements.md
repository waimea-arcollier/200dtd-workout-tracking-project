# Project Requirements

## Identified Problem or Need

My user currently tracks his workouts on a sheet of paper and would like an app to log his workouts in and view his progress


## End-User Requirements

My end user needs a way to see his past workouts, update his rep goals, and log the days he completes each workout.


## Proposed Solution

Replace this text with a brief statement about the system that you intend to create, including the key functionality it should have.

# Relevant Implications

## Functionality

The functionality implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how well it works for the end-user, in terms of meeting its intended purpose.

### Relevance to the System

In order for the web app to be used by the end-user it has to function well with minimal to no glitches or bugs.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to consistently test the features of my app to ensure it is functional. This implication will make me think about the way i write my code so that it is easily fixed and works correctly



## Useability

The usability implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how easy it is to use for the end-user, without the need for help or guidance.

### Relevance to the System

In order for the web app to be usable, buttons need to be clearly labeled, intuitive, visible and accessible.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to name everything accordingly, assure that everything is visible on all device screens, and that the flow of the app is intuitive and not clunky or overcomplicated.



## Aesthetics

The aesthetic implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) relate to how it looks in terms of design.

### Relevance to the System

The design needs to be pleasing to the eye, obey heuristics and have an established theme across the app.

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to choose a colour scheme that my user likes, find out whether they prefer light or dark mode, and use the colours accordingly with the app layout to make the design pleasing and useable. I will also need to consult on choices of buttons over links, checkboxes, icons, and the layout of the app in accordance to my end users tastes.



## End-User

The end-user implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) are connected to the specific needs of the end-user(s).

### Relevance to the System

This app will be designed specifically for my end-user, who is one individual, so the design and functionality must be to his liking. 

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to continuously consult with my end-user on the choices I make throughout the design and coding process and take their feedback into concern when making the web app. The main impact my end user will have is that they do not own a laptop or a computer, and will therefore be using mobile. This means I will need to design the layout around a mobile screen and make sure it is functional on my users device.



## Accessibility

The accessibility implications of a digital technology or digital outcome (e.g. a website) involve ensuring it is available to, and can be used by, all end-users, regardless of their abilities.

### Relevance to the System

As my end user struggles with visibility, I will need to cater to their accessibility needs and follow all other general accessibility conventions

### Impact / Considerations

I will need to make high contrast text colour choices, and ensure that the buttons and text are large enough to be visible.
