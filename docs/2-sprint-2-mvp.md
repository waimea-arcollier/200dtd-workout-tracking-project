# Sprint 2 - A Minimum Viable Product (MVP)


## Sprint Goals

Develop a bare-bones, working web application that provides the key functionality of the system, then test and refine it so that it can serve as the basis for the final phase of development in Sprint 3.

## Testing adding workouts 

Testing adding workouts to the list, by filling out the information on the new workout form, expected and unexpected. Workouts are added with the information inputted and displayed on the home page, containing the information needed Found that workouts could be uploaded without any reps assigned and that reps could be plain text.

![gif of being able to add very large numbers of reps and long names](screenshots/Add-test-1.2.gif)

### Changes / Improvements

Required the reps field to be filled and to be an integer
Added constraints to reps input and name input

## Testing editing and deleting workouts

Testing changing the workouts info, adding info, removing, unexpected values, etc. Info can be changed and removed easily, invalid links are discarded and shown as no video being added. Found similar problems to adding workouts with the reps allowed to be blank and non-integers.
